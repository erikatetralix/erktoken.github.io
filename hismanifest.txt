I was brainwashed by instagram. The platform is cursed with inappropriate memes. 
Ironically, this coin's instagram page got suspended. I am too lazy to contest their decision.
I thought the German army marching song Erika was funny, so I used some of my crypto profits and made this.
It probably will never take off and I barely have to motivation to do anything with it.
I lost interest in the Erika meme, but if anyone still find Erika memes entertaining, have some fun with this coin.
So long as the base network is up, you can trade or hodl ERK.
I created 1,945,000,000 tokens and kept 0.5% of it.
As I am writing this, I think the real Furhrer probably would not approve of this crypto craze.
I just hope some future internet archaeologists will find this.
